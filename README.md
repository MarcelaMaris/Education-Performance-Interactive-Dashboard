# 📊 ENEM Dashboard – 2019 Analysis

This project explores data from **ENEM 2019**, a national standardized exam taken by Brazilian students finishing **high school**.  
Using an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**, it analyzes performance patterns by **gender** and **age group** across multiple subject areas.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the **age distribution** of participants by gender.  
- Explore performance across **different subject areas** by gender and age.  
- Investigate **age–performance patterns** (overall and per subject).  
- Deliver an **interactive web application** for data exploration.

## 🧭 Dashboard Features

- **🎚️ Gender Filter (Multiselect)**  
  Allows selection of one or both genders (female and male) to customize all visualizations.

- **📊 Age Distribution Histogram**  
  Visualizes participant age distribution by gender, highlighting demographic concentration.

- **📈 Math Score Boxplot**  
  Compares mathematics performance between genders, making differences in distribution visible.

- **🌐 Scatter Plot (Age vs Score)**  
  Lets the user select the **type of score** (overall, math, language, humanities, science) and analyze its relationship with age.

## 📌 Conclusions

**Age Distribution**
- Most participants are **15–20 years old**.  
- Participation **drops significantly** after **age 25**.

**Performance by Subject**
- **Overall Score:** concentrated between **400–600**, mostly among ages **15–20**.  
- **Math Score:** males show a **slightly higher median** and **greater dispersion**.  
- **Language Score:** similar distributions by gender, with a **slight female advantage**.  
- **Human Sciences Score:** similar results across genders, concentrated in **mid ranges**.  
- **Natural Sciences Score:** pattern similar to Human Sciences, with **no major gender gaps**.

**Age × Performance**
- **Highest scores** concentrate between **15–20** across all subjects.  
- After **25**, scores become **more dispersed** and generally **lower**.  
- Female scores tend to be **more tightly clustered**; male scores show **greater variability**, especially in Math.

## 📝 Recommendations
- **Targeted support for older candidates (25+)** focusing on content review and test strategies.  
- **Math mentorship for female students** to address small performance gaps.  
- **Deeper analysis of socioeconomic and regional factors** to explain variance.  
- **Multi-year comparison** (other ENEM editions) to validate long-term trends.
